# Vanity Stellar Address Toolkit

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `stellar_sdk` library

1. Run the script by executing the following command:

```bash
python3 generateVanity{FUNCTION}.py
```

2. Enter your desired inputs.

3. View the result.

## Disclaimer

These scripts are for demonstration purposes only. Generating vanity public keys and using them for real-world applications can have security implications. Always exercise caution and follow best practices when working with cryptographic keys. 

It is highly recommended that you avoid using vanity keys in production or sensitive environments. I provide `configureVanitySigners.py` without any warranties or representations to create a transaction replacing a vanity account's signers with your own public keys.
